<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Use your preferred language" icon="seti:json">
        The main focus of Astal is TypeScript using JSX. But you can use the
        libraries in any language that supports [Gobject
        Introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_bindings_for_GTK).
    </Card>
    <Card title="No bash scripts needed" icon="pencil">
        Includes modules to work with Network, Bluetooth, Battery, Audio and
        more. See the list of included [Libraries](/astal/libraries/overview).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Use any Gtk widget" icon="puzzle">
        With Astal you work with Gtk directly. You are not limited to only a set
        of them. See the list of [Widgets](/astal/libraries/widgets) that come
        bundled.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Examples" icon="open-book">
        Have a look at some simple and not simple [examples](./config/examples).
        In [TypeScript](https://github.com/Aylur/Astal/tree/main/examples/ts),
        [Lua](https://github.com/Aylur/Astal/tree/main/examples/lua),
        [Python](https://github.com/Aylur/Astal/tree/main/examples/python).

## Showcases

<div class="showcases">
    {showcases.map((showcase) =>
        Array.isArray(showcase) ? (
            <CardGrid>
                {showcase.map((elem) => (
                    <Showcase {...elem} />
                ))}
            </CardGrid>
        ) : (
            <Showcase {...showcase} />
        ),
    )}
